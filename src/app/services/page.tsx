          <p className="text-[var(--theme-text-secondary)] max-w-4xl mx-auto mb-4">
            I offer specialized security services designed for startups and mid-market companies that need more than basic security but aren&apos;t ready to hire a full security team. All services include documentation, knowledge transfer, and a support period after delivery.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[var(--theme-text-secondary)] max-w-4xl mx-auto mb-4">
            I offer services at multiple price points because I remember what it was like starting out. Sometimes you just need an hour of expert advice ($500 advisory session). Sometimes you need a quick security check before a big demo ($2,500 rapid review). And sometimes you need comprehensive security engineering ($15K+ full projects). Start where it makes sense for your stage and budget. Many clients begin with advisory sessions, then move to larger projects once we&apos;ve built trust and they see the value.
